You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1. Fill up the five-quart jug.

2. Pour the five-quart jug into the empty three-quart jug, until it's full, to end up with exactly two-quarts in the five-quart jug. 

3. Note the two-quart water line on the five-quart jug.

4. Dump out the three-quart jug.

5. Pour the contents of the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug.

6. Fill up the five-quart jug until the noted two-quart line with new water.

7. Dump the contents of the three-quart jug into the five-quart jug, to end up with exactly four quarts.
